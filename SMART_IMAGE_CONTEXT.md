# Smart Image Context System

## Overview

The Smart Image Context System prevents the same image from being processed multiple times by the LLM within a chat session. This significantly improves performance and reduces computational costs while maintaining the conversational context.

## How It Works

### Image Hashing
- Each image is assigned a unique hash based on its content
- The hash is generated from a sample of the base64 image data
- Identical images will always produce the same hash

### Session-Based Tracking
- Each chat session maintains a history of images sent to the LLM
- When an image is encountered again, the system checks if it was already sent
- If found, creates a text reference instead of resending the image

### Reference System
- Previously sent images are referenced with timestamps and descriptions
- The LLM receives context like: `[Referring to PNG image (1920√ó1080, 245.3KB) sent 2m ago]`
- This maintains conversational context without re-processing the image

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Reduced Processing Time**: Same images aren't processed multiple times
- **Lower Memory Usage**: Prevents duplicate image data in API calls
- **Faster Response Times**: Smaller API payloads result in quicker responses

### Cost Efficiency
- **Reduced API Costs**: Less data transferred to LLM services
- **Lower Bandwidth Usage**: Cached images don't need retransmission
- **Improved Resource Utilization**: More efficient use of computational resources

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Users see when images are being referenced vs sent new
- **Context Preservation**: LLM maintains awareness of previous images
- **Transparent Operation**: System shows cache statistics and reference info

## Visual Indicators

### In Chat Messages
- **Blue Reference Badges**: Show when previous images are being referenced
- **Link Icons**: Indicate image references with timestamps
- **Debug Info**: Development mode shows session and image details

### In Chat Input
- **Cache Statistics**: Shows number of cached images in current session
- **Smart Referencing Active**: Indicates when the system is saving resources
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier for the current chat session

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **ImageContextService** (`src/services/imageContextService.js`)
   - Manages image cache and session history
   - Generates unique hashes and reference IDs
   - Provides statistics and cleanup methods

2. **ChatService Integration** (`src/services/chatService.js`)
   - Processes images before sending to LLM
   - Creates reference text for cached images
   - Handles session-based image management

3. **UI Components**
   - **ChatMessages**: Displays reference badges and debug info
   - **ChatInput**: Shows cache statistics and smart referencing status
   - **useChat Hook**: Manages session state and statistics

### Session Management
- Each chat conversation gets a unique session ID
- Session IDs are generated when the chat component mounts
- Clearing chat also clears the session's image history
- Global image cache persists across sessions

### Cache Strategy
- **Session Cache**: Tracks which images were sent in current session
- **Global Cache**: Stores image data and metadata across all sessions
- **Reference Generation**: Creates descriptive references with timestamps
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup when sessions end

## Usage Examples

### First Time Sending Image
```
User: "Analyze this architectural drawing"
[Image: floor-plan.png, 1920√ó1080, 245.3KB]
System: üì§ Sending new image (245.3KB) - Reference ID: img_ref_1_1703123456789
```

### Subsequent References
```
User: "What about the room dimensions?"
System: üîó Using image reference for previously sent image (245.3KB)
LLM receives: "[Referring to PNG image (1920√ó1080, 245.3KB) sent 2m ago] What about the room dimensions?"
```

### Visual Feedback
- Reference badges appear in chat messages
- Cache statistics show in input area: "3 cached üìä Smart referencing active"
- Debug info (dev mode): "üñºÔ∏è Images: 1 | Session: session_1703123456789"

## Configuration

### Session Behavior
- Sessions are automatically created per chat instance
- Session IDs can be customized for different conversation contexts
- Image cache persists until manually cleared or page reload

### Hash Generation
- Uses content-based hashing for reliable duplicate detection
- Samples middle portion of base64 data to avoid header similarities
- Browser-compatible implementation without external dependencies

### Reference Format
- Includes image description, dimensions, file size, and timestamp
- Human-readable format that provides context to the LLM
- Automatically calculates time since first upload

## Development Features

### Debug Information
- Message objects include `_imageDebugInfo` with session details
- Console logging shows cache hits vs new image processing
- Visual debug panels show session statistics

### Statistics API
```javascript
const stats = getImageStats();
// Returns:
// {
//   global: { totalImages: 5, totalSessions: 2, totalReferences: 8 },
//   session: { sessionId: "session_123", imageCount: 3, uniqueImages: [...] }
// }
```

### Manual Cache Management
```javascript
// Clear current session
chatService.clearImageContext(sessionId);

// Clear all cache
imageContextService.clearAll();

// Get detailed statistics
const globalStats = imageContextService.getStats();
const sessionStats = imageContextService.getSessionStats(sessionId);
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Cross-Session References**: Reference images from previous conversations
- **Semantic Similarity**: Detect similar (not identical) images
- **Expiration Policies**: Automatic cleanup of old cached images
- **Export/Import**: Save and restore image context across sessions

### Performance Optimizations
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Store smaller previews for faster hashing
- **Compression Aware**: Better integration with image compression system
- **Background Processing**: Hash generation in web workers

## Best Practices

### For Users
- The system works automatically - no manual intervention needed
- Check cache statistics to see how much resources are being saved
- Clear chat to reset session context when starting new topics

### For Developers
- Use session IDs to group related conversations
- Monitor cache hit rates for performance insights
- Implement proper cleanup in component unmount handlers
- Consider memory usage with large image caches

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Hash Collisions**: Very rare but possible with similar images
- **Memory Growth**: Large caches may need periodic cleanup
- **Session Confusion**: Ensure proper session ID management

### Debug Tools
- Enable development mode for detailed logging
- Check browser console for cache statistics
- Use debug panels to inspect session state
- Monitor network requests for reduced image transfers

## Integration Notes

- Compatible with canvas capture functionality
- Integrates with Redux chat state management
- Supports dual model comparisons

### API Compatibility
- Maintains OpenAI-compatible message format
- Preserves all existing chat functionality
- Backward compatible with non-image messages
- Transparent to LLM services
